# React-Redux Demo

Made while learning React-Redux by completing [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwheJHvseC3I0HuYI2f46oAK)

Topics covered:

- Implementing redux (actions, types, reducers, store)
- Old-style implementation (connect, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
- Modern hooks implementation (useSelector, useDispatch)
- Middleware and redux dev tools
- Async fetching with Axios and Redux Thunk (which allows action creators to return a function)

## How to run:

```
git clone https://github.com/simonpartridge86/react-redux-tutorial.git
npm install
npm start
```
